        <b>numerics4j</b> provides the means to evaluate several useful
        functions.  These functions were developed to be used internally by
        <b>numerics4j</b> but, as they may be useful for other uses outside the
        scope of <b>numerics4j</b>, their implementations are made public for
        general use.  These special functions are broken down into several
        categories:
        <table>
          <tr><th>Category</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <a href="beta.html">Beta</a>
            </td>
            <td>
              Contains several useful functions involving the Beta function.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <a href="erf.html">Error Function</a>
            </td>
            <td>
              Contains several useful functions involving the Error function.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <a href="gamma.html">Gamma</a>
            </td>
            <td>
              Contains several useful functions involving the Gamma function.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

        The <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/integration/TrapezoidalIntegrator.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.integration.TrapezoidalIntegrator</a>
        class provides an implementation of the extended
        <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrapezoidalRule.html">trapezoidal rule</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evaluating definite integrals using the trapezoidal rule involves
        creating a <code>TrapezoidalIntegrator</code> object for a particular
        <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/function/Function.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.function.Function</a>
        object.  Once, the integrator is created, definite integrals can be
        evaluated by calling the <code>integrate</code> method providing the
        limits of integration.  Here is an example of evaluating integrals for
        sine:
        <source>Function sine = new Function() {
    public double evaluate(double x) {
        return Math.sin(x);
    }
};

TrapezoidalIntegrator integrator = new TrapezoidalIntegrator(sine);

// integrate sine from 0 to Pi.
double two = integrator.integrate(0.0, Math.PI);

// integrate sine from Pi/2 to 2 Pi.
double one = integrator.integrate(Math.PI / 2.0, Math.PI);</source>

      <p>
        <b>numerics4j</b> provides the means to create and evaluate infinite
        power series.  See
        <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSeries.html">Power Series</a>
        for an in depth definition of infinite power series.  To create a power
        series, simply subclass
        <a target="_blank"  href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/series/PowerSeries.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.series.PowerSeries</a>
        and provide an implementation for the <code>getTerm</code> method,
        which returns the series terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the <a target="_blank" href="http://functions.wolfram.com/ElementaryFunctions/Exp/06/01/01/0002//">exponetial function</a>
        can be evaulated with a power series:<source>PowerSeries exponential = new PowerSeries() {
    public double getTerm(int n) {
        return 1.0 / factorial(n);
    }
    
    private double factorial(int n) {
        double p = 1.0;
        for(int i = n; i > 0; --i) {
            p *= i;
        }
        return p;
    }
};

double x = exponential.evaluate(2.0); // Math.exp(2.0)
double x = exponential.evaluate(4.0); // Math.exp(4.0)</source>

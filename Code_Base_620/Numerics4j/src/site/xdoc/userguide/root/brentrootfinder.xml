        The <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/root/BrentRootFinder.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.root.BrentRootFinder</a>
        class provides an implementation of 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent's_method">Brent's method</a>.
        Brent's method is a solid, general purpose root finding method.  Its is
        a combination of other root finding methods that offers guaranteed
        convergance such as found with the bisection method but boasts a
        superior rate of convergence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding roots using Brent's method involves creating a
        <code>BrentRootFinder</code> object for a particular
        <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/function/Function.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.function.Function</a>
        object.  Once, the root finder is created, roots can be evaluated
        by calling the <code>findRoot</code> method providing a bracketting
        interval.  Here is an example of finding roots for sine:
        <source>Function sine = new Function() {
    public double evaluate(double x) {
        return Math.sin(x);
    }
};

BrentRootFinder bisection = new BrentRootFinder(sine);

// find the root between 3 and 4.
double pi = brent.findRoot(3.0, 4.0);

// find the root between -1 and 1.
double zero = brent.findRoot(-1.0, 1.0);</source>

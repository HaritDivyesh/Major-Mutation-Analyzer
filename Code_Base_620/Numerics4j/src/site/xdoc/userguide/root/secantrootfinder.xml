      <p>
        The <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/root/SecantRootFinder.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.root.SecantRootFinder</a>
        class provides an implementation of the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SecantMethod.html">secant method</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding roots using the secant method involves creating a
        <code>SecantRootFinder</code> object for a particular
        <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/function/Function.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.function.Function</a>
        object.  Once, the root finder is created, roots can be evaluated
        by calling the <code>findRoot</code> method providing two initial
        approximations to the actual root.  Here is an example of finding roots
        for sine:
        <source>Function sine = new Function() {
    public double evaluate(double x) {
        return Math.sin(x);
    }
};

SecantRootFinder finder = new SecantRootFinder(sine);

// find the root around 3 and 4.
double pi = finder.findRoot(3.0, 4.0);

// find the root around 3.5 and 4.
pi = finder.findRoot(3.5, 4.0);

// find the root around -1 and 1.
double zero = finder.findRoot(-1.0, 1.0);</source>

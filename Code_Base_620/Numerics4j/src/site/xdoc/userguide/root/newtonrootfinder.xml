        The <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/root/NewtonRootFinder.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.root.NewtonRootFinder</a>
        class provides an implementation of
        <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsMethod.html">Newton's method</a>.
        Newton's method is fast converging root finding method that utilizes
        not only a function but the function's derivative.  As such, Newton's
        method only is applicable for functions with a first derivative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding roots using Newton's method involves creating a
        <code>NewtonRootFinder</code> object for a particular
        <a target="_blank" href="../../apidocs/net/sf/doodleproject/numerics4j/function/Function.html">net.sf.doodleproject.numerics4j.function.Function</a>
        object and the function's associated derivative function.  Once, the
        root finder is created, roots can be evaluated
        by calling the <code>findRoot</code> method providing an initial
        approximation to the root.  Here is an example of finding roots for
        sine:
        <source>Function sine = new Function() {
    public double evaluate(double x) {
        return Math.sin(x);
    }
};

Function cosine = new Function() {
    public double evaluate(double x) {
        return Math.cos(x);
    }
};

NewtonRootFinder newton = new NewtonRootFinder(sine, cosine);

// find the root near 3.
double pi = newton.findRoot(3.0);

// find the root near 1.
double zero = newton.findRoot(1.0);</source>

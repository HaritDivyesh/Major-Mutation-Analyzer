      <p>
        <b>numerics4j</b> provides the means to find roots of functions through
        the use of common numerical methods.  The following routines are
        available for root finding:
        <table>
          <tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr>

            </td>
            <td>An implementation of the bisection method.</td>
          </tr>

            <td>
              Techniques to create intervals that bracket a root.  Many root
              finding methods require a bracketted root for initialization in
              order to function properly.

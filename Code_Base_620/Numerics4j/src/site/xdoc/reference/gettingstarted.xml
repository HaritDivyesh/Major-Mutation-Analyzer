    <section name="Getting Started with numerics4j">
      <p>
        This document provides information on how to use <b>numerics4j</b> it
        within a Java project.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Manual Installation">
        <p>
          The is no formal installation process for <b>numerics4j</b> since it
          is not an application, merely a toolkit.  However, to use
          <b>numerics4j</b> it must be integrated into a Java development
          project.  In general terms, this consists of the following steps:
          <ol>
            <li><a href="../download.html">Download</a> the binary distribution of <b>numerics4j</b>.</li>
            <li>Unarchive the entire distribution or at a minimum extract the <code>numerics4j-1.2.jar</code>.</li>
            <li>Include <code>numerics4j-1.2.jar</code> in the project classpath.</li>
          </ol>
          After those steps have been completed, the <b>numerics4j</b> API
          should be accessible within the project and coding and compiling can
          be performed as normal.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Maven 2 Projects">
        <p>
          If <b>numerics4j</b> is to be used in a <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a>
          project, <b>numerics4j</b> can be included in the project using
          Maven's normal dependency bootstrapping provided the correct
          repository configuration is present in the effective POM.  This
          configuration can be set in a couple of ways.  The first way is to add
          the repository directory to a POM:
          <source><![CDATA[
<project>
...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>doodleproject-repo</id>
      <name>Doodleproject Maven 2 Repository</name>
      <url>http://doodleproject.sourceforge.net/maven2/release</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
...
</project>]]></source>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way is to add the repostory to a profile in the
          <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file:
          <source><![CDATA[
<settings>
 ...
 <profiles>
   ...
   <profile>
     <id>doodleproject</id>
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>doodleproject-repo</id>
         <name>Doodleproject Maven 2 Repository</name>
         <url>http://doodleproject.sourceforge.net/maven2/release</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   </profile>
   ...
 </profiles>

 <activeProfiles>
   <activeProfile>doodleproject</activeProfile>
 </activeProfiles>
 ...
</settings>]]></source>
        </p>
        <p>
          For information about configuring repositories, read <a target="_blank" href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html">Guide to using Multiple Repositories</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the repository configured, <b>numerics4j</b> is added to a Maven
          2 project by adding the the following dependency to the POM:<source><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>net.sf.doodleproject</groupId>
  <artifactId>numerics4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.2</version>
</dependency>]]></source>
        </p>

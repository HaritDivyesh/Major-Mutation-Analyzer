# Standalone Java version of the Major Mutation Analyzer.

You can read more about major [here](http://mutation-testing.org/).

The project takes a test suite and your program to test as input. It generates mutants in the code, executes each test case against the mutant, and produces a detailed summary of the results.

Please see the poster/report for a detailed description.
